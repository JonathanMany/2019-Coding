# FirstChallenge
I attended a Science Board meeting on 3/20/18 and duriing that meeting I was absoloutley crushed by a plethora of contructive critiscism,
not just from the science board, but from the job oppurtunities that came to the meeting as well. After that meeting I was inspired to not
just code, but to better my online portfolio.
